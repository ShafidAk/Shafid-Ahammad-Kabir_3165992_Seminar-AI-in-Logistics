### General info
This project is a simple program for guessing a random number within a time period using a random and time module with a loop which executes until the user guesses the correct number.

### Setup
Install Python 3.11.2.
Install any IDE to run the code.
Clone the repository or download the code.
Run the program.


### How to play

The user will be asked to guess a number between 1 and 100 within 30 seconds, once the code is run. The user should only type a number or an invalid input message will be generated and asks to either try again or quit the game. The game can be quit at any time by typing 'q'. 
If the user takes more than 30 seconds to guess the correct number, the game will end. 
When the user guesses the correct number within the time period, the user will win the game with a message showing the number of guesses and the time it took to complete the game.
